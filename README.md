Pet Collection Core  

**Pet Collection Core** is a stripped-down version of the code from my game *DragonCare*, with all paid assets removed. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my code from the project.  

ðŸš§ Important Notice ðŸš§  
Since the paid assets have been removed, this project may not run properly in its current state due to null reference exceptions. However, the core code is fully functional and can be reviewed as-is.  

In the future, once *DragonCare* is complete, I plan to revisit this repository and replace the missing assets with free, self-made art assets. This will allow anyone to download and run the project in the Unity editor.  

ðŸ”¥ Features  
This project includes various gameplay systems written entirely by me, such as:  

- **NPC State Machines**: Uses real-world time to determine pet behavior states.  
- **Pet & Accessory Collection System**: Handles acquiring and managing pets and accessories.  
- **To-Do List Tracking**: Tracks player tasks within the game.  
- **Unity Cloud Authentication**: Implements Unity's authentication system for user login.  
- **Save & Load System**: Uses Unity's save-load functionality.  
- **Custom List Serialization**: A custom-built class for efficiently saving and loading lists.  

ðŸ’¡ How to Use  
At this time, the project is intended for **code review only**, not for running in Unity. Feel free to explore the scripts to see how various game systems are implemented.  

ðŸ›  Future Plans  
Once *DragonCare* is finished, I will:  
- Replace missing assets with free, self-made ones.  
- Ensure the project runs in Unity without paid assets.  
- Provide clear setup instructions.  

ðŸ“Œ About Me  
I am the *sole developer* of this project, and 100% of the code in this repository is my work. I specialize in gameplay programming, system design, and Unity development.
